<https://github.com/cplusplus/concurrency-ts2> is the repository for
the C++ Technical Specification "Concurrency TS 2".

The draft Technical Specification is found in the `src` directory and is
written in LaTeX. There is a Makefile that can be used to compile the
sources, or you can use the `latexmk` program e.g. `latexmk -pdf ts`
will generate a PDF.
