This subclause introduces synchronization primitives called \defn{heavyweight-fences} and
\defn{lightweight-fences}. Like fences, heavyweight-fences and lightweight-fences can have acquire
semantics, release semantics, or both, and can be sequentially consistent (in which case they
are included in the total order \tcode{S} on \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} operations).
A heavyweight-fence shall have all the
synchronization effects of a fence. % (\CppXref{31.11}).
\begin{note}  Heavyweight-fences and
lightweight-fences are distinct from fences.\end{note}

%\pnum
A heavyweight-fence with acquire semantics is called an \defn{acquire heavyweight-fence}. A
heavyweight-fence with release semantics is called a \defn{release heavyweight-fence}. A
lightweight-fence with acquire semantics is called an \defn{acquire lightweight-fence}. A
lightweight-fence with release semantics is called a \defn{release lightweight-fence}.

%\pnum
If there are evaluations A and B, and atomic operations X and Y, both operating on some atomic
object M, such that A is sequenced before X, X modifies M, Y is sequenced before B, and Y
reads the value written by X or a value written by any side effect in the hypothetical release
sequence X would head if it were a release operation, and one of the following hold:
\setenumerate[0]{label=(\alph*)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  A is a release lightweight-fence and B is an acquire heavyweight-fence; or
\item  A is a release heavyweight-fence and B is an acquire lightweight-fence
\end{enumerate}

then any evaluation sequenced before A strongly happens before any evaluation that B is
sequenced before.

\item is a release heavyweight-fence, if \tcode{order == memory\_order::release} is \tcode{true};
\item is both an acquire heavyweight-fence and a release heavyweight-fence, if \tcode{order ==

Depending on the value of \tcode{order}, this operation:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item  has no effects, if \tcode{order == memory\_order::relaxed} is \tcode{true};

\begin{note} Delegating both heavyweight-fence and lightweight-fence functions to an
\tcode{atomic_thread_fence(order)} call is a valid implementation. Implementations can adopt
techniques in which calls to \tcode{asymmetric_thread_fence_light} execute more quickly than calls
to \tcode{atomic_thread_fence} with the same \tcode{memory_order}, at the cost of
\tcode{asymmetric_thread_fence_heavy} executing more slowly than calls to
\tcode{atomic_thread_fence} with the same \tcode{memory_order}\end{note}
