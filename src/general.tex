\rSec1[general.scope]{Scope}
\pnum
This Technical Specification describes requirements for implementations of an interface that computer programs written in the C++ programming language may use to invoke algorithms with concurrent execution. The algorithms described by this Technical Specification are realizable across a broad class of computer architectures.

\pnum
This Technical Specification is non-normative. Some of the functionality described by this Technical Specification may be considered for standardization in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part of any C++ standard. Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never be standardized, and other functionality may be standardized in a substantially changed form.

\pnum
The goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread existing practice for concurrency in the C++ standard algorithms library. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.
