Change in \CppXref{33.5.4} paragraph 4 to remove the word ``four'' from
the clause ``the following four conditions are required to be satisfied
by $S$''.

Add the following two bullets to the list:
\begin{quote}
%%\setcounter{Paras}{3}
\pnum
\begin{itemize}
\item
  ...
\item
if a \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} lightweight-fence $X$ happens before $A$ and $B$ happens
before a \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} heavyweight-fence $Y$, then $X$ precedes $Y$ in $S$; and
\item  if a \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} heavyweight-fence $X$ happens before $A$ and $B$ happens
before a \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} lightweight-fence $Y$, then $X$ precedes $Y$ in $S$.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}
