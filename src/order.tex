% This clause specifies differences in requirements to ISO/IEC 14882:2020
% in order to support asymmetric fences.

% In \CppXref{33.5.4} paragraph 4, instead of:

% \begin{quote}
% ``the following four conditions are required to be satisfied by $S$''.
% \end{quote}

% this document requires:

% \begin{quote}
% ``the following conditions are required to be satisfied by $S$''.
% \end{quote}

In addition to the requirements of ISO/IEC 14882:2020, 33.5.4, the
following conditions are required to be satisfied by $S$:
\begin{quote}
%%\setcounter{Paras}{3}
% \pnum
\begin{itemize}
\item
  ...
\item
if a \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} lightweight-fence $X$ happens before $A$ and $B$ happens
before a \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} heavyweight-fence $Y$, then $X$ precedes $Y$ in $S$; and
\item  if a \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} heavyweight-fence $X$ happens before $A$ and $B$ happens
before a \tcode{memory_order::seq_cst} lightweight-fence $Y$, then $X$ precedes $Y$ in $S$.
