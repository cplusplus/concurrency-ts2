\rSec2[Concurrency2.SafeReclamation.HP.general]{General}

Editor's note: This section was mistakenly unlabeled in P1121R3.

\pnum
A hazard pointer is a single-writer multi-reader pointer that can be owned by at most one thread at any time. Only the owner of the hazard pointer can set its value, while any number of threads may read its value. The owner thread sets the value of a hazard pointer to point to an object in order to indicate to concurrent threads -— that may delete such an object -— that the object is not yet safe to delete.

\pnum
A class type \tcode{T} is \defn{hazard-protectable} if it has exactly one public base class of type \tcode{hazard_pointer_obj_base<T,D>} for some \tcode{D} and no base classes of type \tcode{hazard_pointer_obj_base<T’,D’>} for any other combination \tcode{T’}, \tcode{D’}. An object is \defn{hazard-protectable} if it is of hazard-protectable type.

\pnum
The span between creation and destruction of a hazard pointer $h$ is partitioned into a series of \defn{protection epochs}; in each protection epoch, $h$ either is {\em associated with} a hazard-protectable object, or is \defn{unassociated}. Upon creation, a hazard pointer is unassociated. Changing the association (possibly to the same object) initiates a new protection epoch and ends the preceding one.

\pnum
A hazard pointer \defn{belongs to} exactly one \defn{domain}. 

\pnum
An object of type \tcode{hazard_pointer} is either empty or \defn{owns} a hazard pointer. Each hazard pointer is owned by exactly one object of type \tcode{hazard_pointer}.\\\
[ Note: An empty \tcode{hazard_pointer} object is different from a \tcode{hazard_pointer} object that
owns an unassociated hazard pointer. An empty \tcode{hazard_pointer} object does not own any hazard pointers. -- end note ]

\pnum
An object x of hazard-protectable type \tcode{T} is \defn{retired} to a domain with a deleter of type \tcode{D} when the member function \tcode{hazard_pointer_obj_base<T,D>::retire} is invoked on x. Any given object x shall be retired at most once.

\pnum
A retired object x is \defn{reclaimed} by invoking its deleter with a pointer to x.

\pnum
A hazard-protectable object x is \defn{definitely reclaimable} in a domain $dom$ with respect to
an evaluation A if:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] x is not reclaimed, and
\item[b.] x is retired to $dom$ in an evaluation that happens before A, and
\item[c.] for all hazard pointers $h$ that belong to $dom$, the end of any protection epoch where $h$ is associated with x happens before A.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
A hazard-protectable object x is \defn{possibly reclaimable} in domain $dom$ with respect to an
evaluation A if:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] x is not reclaimed; and
\item[b.] x is retired to $dom$ in an evaluation R and A does not happen before R; and
\item[c.] for all hazard pointers $h$ that belong to $dom$, A does not happen before the end of
any protection epoch where $h$ is associated with x; and
\item[d.] for all hazard pointers $h$ belonging to $dom$ and for every protection epoch E of $h$
during which $h$ is associated with x:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[i.] A does not happen before the end of E, and
  \item[ii.] if the beginning of E happens before x is retired, the end of E strongly
happens before A, and
  \item[iii.] if E began by an evaluation of \tcode{try_protect} with argument \tcode{src}, label its
atomic load operation L. If there exists an atomic modification B on \tcode{src} such that L observes a modification that is modification-ordered before B, and B happens before x is retired, the end of E strongly happens before A. [ Note: In typical use, a store to src sequenced before retiring x will be such an atomic operation B. -- end note ]
\end{itemize}
[ Note: The latter two conditions convey the informal notion that a protection
epoch that began before retiring x, as implied either by the happens-before
relation or the coherence order of some source, delays the reclamation of x. -- end note ]
\end{itemize}

[ Example—- The following example shows how hazard pointers allow updates to be carried out in the presence of concurrent readers. The object of type \tcode{hazard_pointer} in \tcode{print_name} protects the object \tcode{*ptr} from being reclaimed by \tcode{ptr->retire} until the end of the protection epoch.

\begin{codeblock}
struct Name : public hazard_pointer_obj_base<Name> { /* details */ };
atomic<Name*> name;

// called often and in parallel!
void print_name() {
  hazard_pointer h = make_hazard_pointer();
  Name* ptr = h.protect(name); /* Protection epoch starts */
  /* ... safe to access *ptr ... */
} /* Protection epoch ends. */

// called rarely, but possibly concurrently with print_name
void update_name(Name* new_name) {
  Name* ptr = name.exchange(new_name);
  ptr->retire();
}
\end{codeblock}
-—end example ]

\rSec3[Concurrency2.SafeReclamation.HP.domain.general]{General}

\pnum
The number of unreclaimed possibly-reclaimable objects retired to a domain is bounded.
The bound is implementation-defined. [ Note: The bound can be independent of other
domains and can be a function of the number of hazard pointers belonging to the
domain, the number of threads that retire objects to the domain, and the number of
threads that use hazard pointers belonging to the domain. -- end note ]

\pnum
Concurrent access to a domain does not incur a data race ([intro.races)].

\begin{codeblock}
class hazard_pointer_domain {
public:
  hazard_pointer_domain() noexcept;
  explicit hazard_pointer_domain(
    pmr::polymorphic_allocator<byte> poly_alloc) noexcept;

  hazard_pointer_domain(const hazard_pointer_domain&) = delete;
  hazard_pointer_domain& operator=(const hazard_pointer_domain&) = delete;

  ~hazard_pointer_domain();
};

\pnum
Effects: Equivalent to\\
\hspace*{1.1em}\tcode{hazard_pointer_domain(\{\});}
\\

\tcode{explicit hazard_pointer_domain(}\\
\hspace*{1.1em}\tcode{pmr::polymorphic_allocator<byte> poly_alloc) noexcept;}

[@@@ how to reset pnum?]

\pnum
Remarks: All allocation and deallocation related to hazard pointers belonging to this
domain use a copy of \tcode{poly_alloc}.
\\

\tcode{\~hazard_pointer_domain();}

\pnum
Preconditions: All hazard pointers belonging to \tcode{*this} have been destroyed.

\pnum
Effects: Reclaims all objects retired to this domain that have not yet been reclaimed.

\rSec2[Concurrency2.SafeReclamation.HP.domain.default]{Default \tcode{hazard_pointer_domain}}

\tcode{hazard_pointer_domain\& hazard_pointer_default_domain() noexcept;}

\pnum
Returns: A reference to the default \tcode{hazard_pointer_domain}.

\pnum
Remarks: The default domain has an unspecified allocator and has static storage
duration. The initialization of the default domain strongly happens before this function
returns; the sequencing is otherwise unspecified.

\rSec2[Concurrency2.SafeReclamation.HP.cleanup]{Clean up}

\tcode{void hazard_pointer_clean_up(}\\
\hspace*{1.1em}\tcode{hazard_pointer_domain\& domain = hazard_pointer_default_domain()) noexcept;}

\pnum
Effects: May reclaim possibly-reclaimable objects retired to domain.

\pnum
Postconditions: All definitely-reclaimable objects retired to domain have been reclaimed.

\pnum
Synchronization: The completion of the deleter for each reclaimed object synchronizes
with the return from this function call.

\rSec2[Concurrency2.SafeReclamation.HP.base]{Class template \tcode{hazard_pointer_obj_base}}

\begin{codeblock}
template <typename T, typename D = default_delete<T>>
class hazard_pointer_obj_base {
public:
  void retire(
    D d = D(),
    hazard_pointer_domain& domain = hazard_pointer_default_domain())
    noexcept;
  void retire(hazard_pointer_domain& domain) noexcept;
protected:
  hazard_pointer_obj_base() = default;
private:
  D deleter; // exposition only
};
\end{codeblock}

\pnum
A client-supplied template argument \tcode{D} shall be a function object type ([function.object])
for which, given a value \tcode{d} of type \tcode{D} and a value \tcode{ptr} of type \tcode{T*}, the expression \tcode{d(ptr)} is valid and has the effect of disposing of the pointer as appropriate for that deleter.

\pnum
The behavior of a program that adds specializations for \tcode{hazard_pointer_obj_base} is undefined.

\pnum
\tcode{D} shall meet the requirements for Cpp17DefaultConstructible and Cpp17MoveAssignable.

\pnum
\tcode{T} may be an incomplete type.
\\

\tcode{void retire(}\\
\hspace*{1.1em}\tcode{D d = D(),}\\
\hspace*{1.1em}\tcode{hazard_pointer_domain\& domain = hazard_pointer_default_domain()) noexcept;}

Editor's note: The following paragraphs are misnumbered in P1121R3.

\pnum
Mandates: \tcode{T} is a hazard-protectable type.

\pnum
Preconditions: \tcode{*this} is a base class subobject of an object x of type \tcode{T}. x is not retired.
Move-assigning \tcode{D} from \tcode{d} does not throw an exception. The expression \tcode{d(addressof(x))} has well-defined behavior and does not throw an exception.

\pnum
Effects: Move-assigns \tcode{d} to \tcode{deleter}, thereby setting it as the deleter of x, then retires x
to domain.

\pnum
Invoking the retire function may reclaim possibly-reclaimable objects retired to domain.
